# ProcessingInputOutput

Write a `ZIPEnumerator` utility that searches a directory (specified in the constructor) and all subdirectories for zip files.

Provide a function that returns a list Path objects to all zip files found

ZIPEnumerator should have a constructor flag that sets whether it also lists jar files.

provide another function that lists only the names of all of the files found

Add a method to the `ZipEnumerator` to add a file to a selected ZIP archive. This should accept either a Path to the zip (within the directory structure searched by this instance) or the name of the file. If the name (as a string) is not unique throw an `AmbiguousFileNameException`. Include an optional parameter for the path within the ZIP to write the file; if it is not specified then write the file to `/` within the ZIP filesystem.
